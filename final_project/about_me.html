                <h2 class="h1text">Hello my name is Joey Valdez.</h2>
                <p class="p1">I am a student from Fairmont high school and I am in the info technology at our Career
                    Tech Center (CTC). I have always had an interest in how things work, which is how I developed the
                    interest in computers. I was first introduced when I was ten years old by my cousin to the idea that
                    you could build your own computer. That was what started my interest in computers. I was fascinated
                    with the fact that regular people could just buy parts and build their own computers. I would then
                    later go to one to save up and build one of my own. I didnâ€™t stop there and decided to learn how to
                    code some simple languages to try to create my own video games. I learned the basics of C#, C++,
                    Javascript, and Python. The thought that I could tell a computer exactly what I wanted to do was
                    crazy to me.</p>

                <h2 class="h1text">Computers are not the only thing I found passionate about.</h2>
                <p class="p1">In the last three years, I have become very good at soccer. I played while I was younger
                    but was never really serious about it. Once I hit high school and saw the competitiveness that came
                    with it, I fell in love with the sport. Most of my out-of-school life became soccer. I would come
                    home from school and immediately start training almost every day for almost two years. I was put and
                    am still currently playing on a very good club team called DPA (Dayton Players Academy). With all
                    the hard work I put in those few years, I made the best team, showcase, in my age level. Soccer has
                    been a big part of my life.</p>

                <h2 class="h1text">Recently I have been going to my church more often.</h2>
                <p class="p1">I have gone to church my whole life but it was more because my mom would make me go.
                    Recently I have been going to a youth group and have been enjoying it a lot. I feel like this time I
                    am going to church because I want to and want to build a better relationship with God. That is
                    something I am still trying to build and work on. I also play the piano and have been for three
                    years now. I first started on an old electric piano, but developed a passion for it and started
                    taking lessons. I like being able to play the piano and it is something I like to do to relax. I
                    never plan on quitting the piano and hope I will always be able to play. Another new thing that I
                    have started is that I joined my high school's Hope Squad. I think that this is a great opportunity
                    for me. Not only do I get to help people, but it is also a class that involves me having to do
                    things that might be out of my comfort zone.</p>
